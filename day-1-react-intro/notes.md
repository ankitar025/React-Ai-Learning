🚀 Day 1 – React.js + AI learning journey

📌 React Topic: Introduction to React
 📌 AI Topic: Understanding how AI works with the frontend

📌 What is React.js?
React.js is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications. It allows us to create reusable components and update the UI efficiently.

📌 Why React?
1. Component-based structure
2. Fast UI updates using Virtual DOM
3. Reusable code
4. Easy to maintain large applications

🧠 Simple example:
 Instead of writing the same HTML again and again, React lets us create a component once and reuse it anywhere.
👉 This saves time and keeps code clean.

🧠 Today I learned how React is used to build dynamic UI using components and how AI can be integrated into React apps using APIs. 
💡 React handles the interface, AI handles the intelligence.

💡 Key takeaway:
 React helps build clean, maintainable, and scalable UI.
